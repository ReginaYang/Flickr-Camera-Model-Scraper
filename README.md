## Flickr Camera Model Scraper
This is a simple Python script that scrapes Flickr.com for a list of all camera models organized by manufacturer.

## Requirements
- [Beautiful Soup 4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

## Usage
There are no command line parameters. Set appropriate permissions and run the script.

## Why?
Just a simple example of how information can be collected from websites. This uses urllib2 since it was written before I was aware of [Python Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html), which has a much better API.
